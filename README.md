‚ö†Ô∏è early pre-release

**[www.zzzbot.dev](https://www.zzzbot.dev/)**

Zzz (pronounced "zees" like the sound of electricity)
is an open source web UI and toolkit
that builds on [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

It's designed for plugins,
and it comes with batteries included for AI and local-first personal data/file management.

This is a pre-alpha - there's a lot to figure out and nothing is documented yet.
